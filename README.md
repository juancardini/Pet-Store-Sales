Data Analytics: Pet Store Sales in 2020
The objective of this final work was to carry out the analysis of dataset data on US pet store sales in 2020. I decided to choose this topic because I am a biochemist and I am also interested in the world of veterinary medicine.
The dataset was obtained from the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ippudkiippude/pet-store-records-2020
This dataset contains related information:
-sales
-Prices
-Type of pet
-pet size
-country of origin of the products
-Rating
-repurchase
Add a column called rating that through the use of the IF function allows you to rank in excellent, very good, good and fair.
After you have chosen this dataset, the following is done:
• Convert text to columns
• Format the table (font, alignment, borders and panel freeze)
• Application of conditional formatting (colors and icons)
• Mention Spanish references to column headings
• Data standardization and validation 
• Both pivot tables and pivot charts were made and then a dashboard was developed
